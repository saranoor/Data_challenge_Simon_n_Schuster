# EDA and Time Series Modelling of a company's sales data

# Description

I had a real dataset of a compnay that contains information about the sales and revenues of their products. I have carried out data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization of univariate time series of companies sales and have predicted product's sales revenue using TIme series ARMA model with 75% accuracy. 

# Packages 
I have used the following libraries

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Pylab
- pmdarima.arima 

# Setup/Installation
The program can be run using jupyter notebook using EDA_ts_sns.ipynb (You may need to change the directory in the code to your personal computer directory).
